# Polygon complexity system

This system requires both **Python 3** and **Node.js** environments.

##  Getting Started

### 1. Start the Frontend
Navigate to the `polygon_complexity` directory and run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the frontend server using Vite.
### 2. Start the Backend
Navigate to the `polygon_complexity_flask` directory and run:
```bash
python app.py
```
This will start the Flask backend server.
##  Configuration
The frontend and backend ports are set in `polygon_complexity/vite.config.js`

Default ports:

- Web interface: 5173
- Backend API: 5000

Make sure both the frontend and backend are running before accessing the system.
